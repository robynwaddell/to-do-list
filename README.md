## Using JavaScript to add elements to an HTML
JavaScript is a very powerful tool. With this project I wanted to practice and demonstrate how we can add into our base HTML code with JavaScript. In this project we use this technique to add list items to an unordered list. This way our page is more sophistcated and only shows the user exactly what they want, rather than an empty list with only a few filled in slots. This technique makes your page appear more clean and professional. The function I used to achieve this is this: ![screenshot of code]()assets/img/Screenshot 2023-11-08 143015.png
## Steps
1. Create your files. You will need an index.html, CSS style sheet, and a index.js.
2. In index be sure to include an empty unordered list. This is where we will target in JavaScript to add the list items.
3. Style using CSS. Keep it clean and modern but make sure to add personal style or design elements.
4. Go to your JavaScript document. Begin by linking your id's or classes to a variable.
5. Create a function that will create a new `li` everytime the function is called. Then create a function that adds the input to that `li`. This function should also validate that the input is not empty.
6. Call this function with `addEventListner` and call it either on a `'click'` event or a `'keypress'` event.
## Future Steps
To take this project to the next level I plan to continue to work on it by adding in th ability to save lists using an API. This would allow clients to create multiple running lists at a time.  I also want to add a clear button to completely wipe a list instead of having to remove each list item individually.  I think a slightly easier change I hope to incorporate soon would be a check box on the list items that allows uses to check there instead of anywhere along the list item.
